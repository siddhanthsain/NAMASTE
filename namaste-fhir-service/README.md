# NAMASTE FHIR Terminology Service

A FHIR R4-compliant terminology microservice that maps India's NAMASTE codes (National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic) to WHO ICD-11 TM2 and biomedical equivalents — built in response to the Ministry of Ayush + SIH 2025 problem statement.

---

## Problem

India has 7 lakh+ registered Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani (ASU) practitioners diagnosing patients daily. Their diagnoses exist only as free text or NAMASTE codes — invisible to:

- Insurance systems (need ICD codes for claims)
- Global health databases (need ICD-11 for reporting)
- ABDM / NHCX (need FHIR R4 for interoperability)

WHO released ICD-11 TM2 (Chapter 26) in February 2025 covering 529 ASU disorder categories — but no production EMR has integrated it. The NAMASTE → ICD-11 mapping pipeline does not exist anywhere.

## Solution

This microservice sits between any Ayurveda EMR and ABDM. It:

1. Ingests NAMASTE codes from CSV
2. Queries WHO ICD-11 API to suggest TM2 + biomedical equivalents
3. Stores mappings with confidence scores in MongoDB
4. Exposes FHIR R4 CodeSystem + ConceptMap endpoints
5. Provides autocomplete REST API for EMR integration

## Architecture
```
Ayurveda EMR
     ↓
POST /namaste/search?q=jwara        ← autocomplete
POST /mapping/suggest/{code}        ← WHO ICD-11 lookup
GET  /fhir/CodeSystem/namaste       ← FHIR R4 CodeSystem
GET  /fhir/ConceptMap/namaste-to-icd11  ← FHIR R4 ConceptMap
     ↓
ABDM / NHCX / Insurance Systems
```

## Live Demo Output
```
AYU-0001 Jwara (Fever)
  → TM2:        SE31  Growth fever disorder (Chapter 26)
  → Biomedicine: MG26  Fever of other or unknown origin
  → Status:     complete | Confidence: 100%

AYU-0007 Madhumeha (Diabetes Mellitus)
  → Biomedicine: 5A14  Diabetes mellitus, type unspecified
  → Status:     partial | Confidence: 100%

AYU-0005 Amavata (Rheumatoid Arthritis)
  → Biomedicine: FA20.Z  Rheumatoid arthritis
  → Status:     partial | Confidence: 100%
```
